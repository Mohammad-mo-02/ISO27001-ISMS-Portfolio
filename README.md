# ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) Portfolio

This repository contains my academic ISO 27001 implementation portfolio for the fictional fintech company **XY Innovate**, created as part of my MSc Cybersecurity coursework.

The project showcases a complete ISO 27001 implementation for a digital wallet service, including scope definition, risk assessment (OCTAVE Allegro), Statement of Applicability, and custom policy documents.
